# Image Processing using OpenCV in Python

This Python script demonstrates the use of kernels for image processing, specifically for edge detection, using the OpenCV library. The script generates a black image with two white squares, applies a kernel to detect the edges of the squares, and then displays the original and processed images.

## Expected Output

Upon running this script, you will see two images displayed:

1. The original image: a black image with two white squares.
2. The processed image: the original image with the edges highlighted due to the application of the kernel.

## Modification

You can modify this script by changing the kernel and seeing how it affects the output. Kernels can be designed to detect various features, such as edges, corners, etc. Try experimenting with different kernels and observe the results.

## Conclusion

This script provides a simple example of applying a kernel to an image using the OpenCV library in Python. It's a good starting point for anyone interested in image processing and computer vision.
